# Trade Crypto Coins

## Overview

Trade Crypto Coins is a NodeJS web application that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies using Bitcoin and Ethereum as case studies. This project utilizes TypeScript and the ExpressJS framework, with the Pug templating language for rendering the views. The web app includes user authentication, transaction tracking, and an admin dashboard.

## Features

- User authentication: users can register, login, and logout, with some routes restricted to logged-in users only.

- Buy function: logged-in users can select and buy Bitcoin or Ethereum.

- Wallet ID and payment proof upload: users can provide their wallet ID and upload payment proof in image format.

- Transaction tracking: the app tracks and displays pending, approved, and cancelled transactions.

- Admin dashboard: the admin can view all transactions and approve or cancel pending transactions.

## Challenges

- Power outage: the development process was interrupted by an unexpected power outage, which resulted in a delay in the completion of the project.

## Things To Do

- Form validation: implement form validation with mongoose to ensure user input is correct and follows specified criteria.

- UI/UX design: improve the design of the login, sign up, and buy forms to make them more visually appealing and user-friendly.

- Code refactor: refactor some modules for readability following best practices, such as breaking down large functions into smaller ones and using more descriptive variable names.
